      <div class="bio">
        <h3 class="text-secondary">BIO</h3>
        <p>I have sought a multitude of experiences to acquire a vast array of skills in pursuit of my lifelong goal,
          entrepreneurship. I have overcome many trials and challenges as well as learned many valuable lessons. Through this
          experience, I have earned the confidence to know I can learn anything and perform as required in any field.</p>
        
         <p> With that being said, I do have a couple areas of expertise. First, I am an excellent and passionate salesman. I began
          learning selling skills as a teenager both from front-line customer interaction and attending an evangelical church.
          This skillset was refined through years of customer service, interaction, and specific job responsibilities. It seems
          everywhere I have worked I have needed my selling ability.</p>
        
          <p>Second, I have acquired intermediate technical abilities. As an electrician, I learned wiring fundamentals and how
          electricity is transmitted and stored. In the army, I learned analog and digital communication technologies with a
          focus on RF Networks. I also learned intermediate level computer skills and troubleshooting methods. This knowledge
          has been expanded through personal study and practice with web app development and learning coding languages such as
          HTML, CSS, javascript, PHP, MySQL, and frameworks such as node.js, express, react, bootstrap, and mongoose. Learning
          these technologies also lead to advanced knowledge of Windows and Linux operating systems.</p>
        
          <p>Third, I am a licensed class A CDL driver with 8 years of OTR experience. I have traveled through all 48 continental
          US States as well as into Canada. I have driven through various terrains and weather conditions with a zero accident
          history. I have pulled reefers, box, flatbed, rgn, lowboy, and grain hoppers. Overdimensional loads were common. This
          experience also gave me a strong ability to work independently with little to no supervision.</p>
        
          <p>In conclusion, I know I will be an asset to any company I work for. I bring an advanced understanding of interpersonal
          relations and sales, a strong ability to function in highly technical fields, and the work ethic to get things done
          ahead of schedule. Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
